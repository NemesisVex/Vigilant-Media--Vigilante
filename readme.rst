Vigilant Media: Vigilante
=========================

Vigilante was the name of a custom-made content management system used by the Vigilant Media Network from 2000 to 2008.

The code base for this CMS was supplanted by CodeIgniter and was since obsoleted.

Vigilante housed documentation for this CMS. After its retirement, the site became the single-source repository for the Vigilant Media Network install of CodeIgniter.

The site also served as a content distribution network, serving JavaScript and CSS common to all Vigilant Media Network sites.

In 2013, Amazon S3 supplanted Vigilante's CDN duties. This repository serves as an archive.
