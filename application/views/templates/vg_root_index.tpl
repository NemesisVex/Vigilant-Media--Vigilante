	<p>This site has served a number of purposes over the years.</p>

	<p>At first, it documented a custom-made content management system code named <strong>Vigilante</strong>.</p>

	<p>When that content management system was obsoleted in favor of CodeIgniter, it became the content delivery network for the Vigilant Media Network.</p>

	<p>CDN duties moved over to Amazon S3, and CodeIgniter was eventually replaced with Laravel.</p>

	<p>This site now serves as an archive.</p>
